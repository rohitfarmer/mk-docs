# How to use Neovim or VIM Editor as an IDE for R
Note: This tutorial is written for Linux based systems. 

<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R/master/doc/Nvim-R.txt" target="_blank">Nvim-R official documentation</a>

## Requirements

### R >= 3.0.0
To install the latest version of R please flollow the download and install instructions at [https://cloud.r-project.org/](https://cloud.r-project.org/)

### Neovim >= 0.2.0
[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) (nvim) is the continuation and extension of Vim editor with the aim to keep the good parts of Vim and add more features. In this tutorial I will be using Neovim (nvim), however, most of the steps are equally applicable to Vim also. Please follow download and installation instructions on nvim's GitHub wiki [https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim).

**OR**  

### Vim >= 8.1
[Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) usually comes installed in most of the Linux based operating system. However, it may not be the latest one. Therefore, to install the latest version please download and install it from Vim's GitHub repository as mentioned below or a method that is more confortable to you.

```
git clone https://github.com/vim/vim.git
make -C vim/
sudo make install -C vim/
```

### Plugin Manager
There are more than one plugin manager's available for Vim that can be used to install the required plugins. In this tutorial I will be using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) pluggin manager. 

### Plugins
In the end below are the plugins that we would need to convert Vim editor into a fully functional IDE for R. 

1. Nvim-R: [https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R](https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R) 
   * Nvim-R is the main plugin that will add the functionality to execute R code from within the Vim editor.
1. Ncm-R: [https://github.com/gaalcaras/ncm-R](https://github.com/gaalcaras/ncm-R)
   * Ncm-R adds synchronous auto completion features for R.
   * It is based on [ncm2](https://github.com/ncm2/ncm2) and [nvim-yarp](https://github.com/roxma/nvim-yarp) plugins. 
1. Nerd Tree: [https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree)
   * Nerd Tree will be used to toggle file explorer in the side panel.
1. DelimitMate: [https://github.com/Raimondi/delimitMate](https://github.com/Raimondi/delimitMate)
   * This plug-in provides automatic closing of quotes, parenthesis, brackets, etc.
1. Vim-monokai-tasty: [https://github.com/patstockwell/vim-monokai-tasty](https://github.com/patstockwell/vim-monokai-tasty)
   * Monokai color scheme inspired by Sublime Text's interpretation of monokai.
1. Lightline.vim: [https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim)
   * Lineline.vim adds asthetic enhancements to Vim's statusline/tabline.

## Procedure

1. Make sure that you have `R >=3.0.0` installed. 
2. Make sure that you have `Neovim >= 0.2.0` installed. 
3. Install the `vim-plug` plugin manager.
```
curl -fLo ~/.local/share/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

4. Install the required plugins.

First, create an `init.vim` file in `~/.config/nvim` folder (create the folder if it doesn't exist). This file is equivalent to a `.vimrc` file in the traditional Vim environment. To `init.vim` file start adding:

```bash
" Specify a directory for plugins
" - Avoid using standard Vim directory names like 'plugin'
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')

" List of plugins.
" Make sure you use single quotes

" Shorthand notation
Plug 'jalvesaq/Nvim-R'
Plug 'ncm2/ncm2'
Plug 'roxma/nvim-yarp'
Plug 'gaalcaras/ncm-R'
Plug 'preservim/nerdtree'
Plug 'Raimondi/delimitMate'
Plug 'patstockwell/vim-monokai-tasty'
Plug 'itchyny/lightline.vim'

" Initialize plugin system
call plug#end()
```

5. Update and add more features to the `init.vim` file.

```bash
" Set a Local Leader

" With a map leader it's possible to do extra key combinations
" like <leader>w saves the current file
let mapleader = ","
let g:mapleader = ","

        geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = F) +

             y = "Population",
             x = "Area",
             title = "Scatterplot",
             caption = "Source: midwest")

plot(gg) # Opens an external window with the plot.

midwest$county # To show synchronous auto completion. 

View(midwest) # Opens an external window to display a portion of the tibble.
```

## Add Colour etc. to VIM in a Screen Session (optional)
Add these lines to `~/.screenrc` file.
```bash
# Use 256 colors
attrcolor b ".I"    # allow bold colors - necessary for some reason
termcapinfo xterm 'Co#256:AB=\E[48;5;%dm:AF=\E[38;5;%dm'   # tell screen how to set colors. AB = background, AF=foreground
defbce on    # use current bg color for erased chars]]'

# Informative statusbar
hardstatus off
hardstatus alwayslastline
hardstatus string '%{= kG}[ %{G}%H %{g}][%= %{= kw}%?%-Lw%?%{r}(%{W}%n*%f%t%?(%u)%?%{r})%{w}%?%+Lw%?%?%= %{g}][%{B} %m-%d %{W} %c %{g}]'

# Use X scrolling mechanism
termcapinfo xterm* ti@:te@

# Fix for residual editor text
