# Lists: Bullets, Numbers, Capitalization, Punctuation
https://editorsmanual.com/articles/lists/

## Summary
A list may be vertical or horizontal. A vertical list is often introduced by a complete sentence followed by a colon.

The following tasks are pending:
* Changing the sparkplug
* Oiling the wheels
* Launching the rocket ship

Use numbers instead of bullet points when the order or number of elements in the list is important.

Follow these steps:
1. Change the sparkplug.
2. Oil the wheels.
3. Launch the rocket ship.

The items in a vertical list are generally capitalized. Use a period at the end of a list item only if it is a complete sentence.

A horizontal (or run-in) list may contain numbering if the list elements are meant to stand out from the text.

We still have to clean the windows, stock the pantry, and refuel the ship. Today, we must (a) clean the windows, (b) stock the pantry, and (c) refuel the ship.

## What is a list?
A list is a useful way to organize information and present it clearly and logically. The elements in a list stand out typographically from the rest of the text, thus encouraging the reader to focus on them.

### EXAMPLES
The things I miss most in this apocalypse are (a) diet soda, (b) toilet paper, and (c) good moisturizer.

In the basement we found some interesting items:
* A torn notebook
* An old scarf
* A half-eaten candle

## When to use a list
Before creating a list, ask yourself whether you need one. Remember that a list stands out from the rest of the text. Therefore, it is best used to present important information that is logically organized and similarly structured.

Don’t overuse lists in writing. To maintain a natural tone, use paragraphs to convey information, occasionally using lists to clarify ideas for your reader.

A list may be laid out vertically or horizontally. It may be punctuated, indented, bulleted, and numbered.

## Vertical lists
Vertical lists are more prominent than horizontal ones and stand out more from the rest of the text.

### Numbers, bullets, and indentation
Vertical lists are usually indented and either bulleted or numbered.

#### EXAMPLES
Farley carried three things on his journey to the North Pole:
* A gold watch
* A fountain pen
* A silk vest

To swim, follow these steps:
1. Buy a swimsuit.
2. Find a pool.
3. Jump in.
4. Move your arms and legs, and keep your nose above water.

Bullets or numbers are not essential and are sometimes omitted—for example, when ingredients are listed in a recipe.

#### EXAMPLE
Ingredients
> 2 teaspoons sugar  
> 3 tablespoons butter  
> 1 cup cracker crumbs  
> 1 cup peas  
> 1 diced potato  

Indentation, though preferred, may be omitted—for example, in a restaurant menu.

#### EXAMPLE
**Tea**
English Breakfast
Earl Grey
Darjeeling
Golden orange pekoe

**Coffee**
Espresso
Americano
Latte
Cappuccino
Numbers versus bullets

If the sequence of the listed items is important, use a numbered (i.e., ordered) list.

#### EXAMPLE
To restart the device, follow these steps:
1. Unplug the device from its power source.
2. Turn around three times.
3. Touch your nose with your index finger.
4. Plug the device back in.
5. Wait until you see a green light.
6. Press the red button.

You may also use a numbered list to emphasize the number of items.

#### EXAMPLE
You need to bring just three things on this trip:
1. A flashlight
2. A camera
3. Your sense of adventure

Letters instead of numbers are generally used to present a list of options, such as in a quiz with multiple-choice questions.

#### EXAMPLE
How many foreign countries have you visited in the last year?
a. None
b. 1–3
c. 4–7
d. More than 7

*NOTE: Letters may be used in multilevel or nested lists, which are lists with sublevels within them.*

Use bullets instead of numbers when the sequence or number of elements in your list is not important. Such lists are called unordered lists. Changing the sequence of items in such a list does not affect meaning or make the list difficult to understand.

#### EXAMPLE
During your stay, you have access to these amenities:
* Pool
* Gym
* Jacuzzi
* Concierge desk
* Restaurant

### When to capitalize list elements
The elements in a vertical list are often capitalized. This capitalization style is relatively simple and thus preferred by many. It has the additional advantage of making each of the listed points stand out.

#### EXAMPLE
In this chapter, we discuss the following:
* Count nouns
* Mass nouns
* Nouns that are both count and mass

However, capitalization is not always necessary, especially in a list that isn’t bulleted or numbered, or introduced by a sentence followed by a colon.

#### EXAMPLES
Document checklist
> application form
> proof of residence
> bank statement

Weekly grocery list
> eggs
> milk
> muesli
> bread
> olives
> lettuce
> tomatoes

### How to punctuate a list
If the points in your list are complete sentences, use terminal punctuation (periods or question marks).

#### EXAMPLES
In this lesson, we discuss the following:
* What are em dashes?
* What are en dashes?
* How are they different?

Here are the steps to a hearty lentil soup:
1. Wash and boil lentils.
2. Season with salt.
3. Put away to use later.
4. Order Ezogelin soup from the nearest Turkish restaurant.

If your list isn’t made up of complete sentences, periods aren’t required.

#### EXAMPLE
To assemble the furniture yourself, you need the following:
* Allen keys
* Spirit level
* Power drill
* Pencil
* Patience

Lists may also be punctuated as complete sentences. Don’t use a colon to introduce such a list. End each list item with a comma, and use a period at the end of the list. Since such a list is meant to be read as a sentence, don’t capitalize any of the individual points.

#### EXAMPLE
In the treasure chest, we found
* another map,
* an empty bottle,
* a human skull.

Use semicolons if the points in your list contain internal commas. An and before the final element is optional.

#### EXAMPLE
You will need
* a wooden plank, two feet wide and four feet tall;
* a box of paints, preferably acrylic; and
* a steady hand.

### When to use a colon to introduce a list
Use a colon after a complete sentence or independent clause to introduce a list.

#### EXAMPLE
For the apocalypse, pack the following:
* Surgical masks
* Hand sanitizer
* Toilet paper

Don’t place a colon after a simple heading or introductory phrase.

#### EXAMPLE
Main Characters
> Farley  
> Tumkin  
> Lulu  
> Anita  
> Poco  
> Nesbit  
> Maya  
> Rita  

**CAUTION**  
Use a colon only after a complete introductory sentence.
```
EXAMPLES
Incorrect 
    This year, Tumkin will visit:
    Thailand
    Vietnam
    Indonesia

Correct  
This year, Tumkin will visit the following countries:
    Thailand
    Vietnam
    Indonesia
```

If you don’t introduce the list using a complete sentence, the list itself can be the sentence.

#### EXAMPLE
This year, Tumkin will visit
* Thailand,
* Vietnam,
* Indonesia.

Such a list is better laid out horizontally, especially if the list items are short.

#### EXAMPLE
This year, Tumkin will visit Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.

*NOTE: The serial comma before and after the second-last item in a horizontal list is optional but often preferred, especially in formal writing in American English.*

## Multilevel lists
You may sometimes need more than one level to create an effective outline. Such multilevel lists (or outlines) work particularly well as project plans, hierarchies, and indexes (take a look at the table of contents on this page). If number, sequence, or chronology are important, use numbers and letters for each element in the list (I, A, 1, a, i); otherwise, use variously sized and shaped bullets (•, ◦, ▪).

### EXAMPLE
Geographical regions of the world
```
A. Africa
  1. Northern Africa
  2. Sub-Saharan Africa
    - Eastern Africa
    - Middle Africa
    - Southern Africa
    - Western Africa
B. Americas
  1. Latin America and the Caribbean
    - Caribbean
    - Central America
    - South America
  2. Northern America
C. Asia
  1. Central Asia
  2. Eastern Asia
  3. Southeastern Asia
  4. Southern Asia
  5. Western Asia
D. Europe
  1. Eastern Europe
  2. Northern Europe
  3. Southern Europe
  4. Western Europe
E. Oceania
  1. Australia and New Zealand
  2. Melanesia
  3. Micronesia
  4. Polynesia
```

*NOTE: You may use any sequential numbering system (e.g., [I, A, 1, a, i] or [1, 1.1, 1.1.1]) as long as it makes the hierarchy of the levels clear to your reader.*

As with any list, if the sequence or number of list elements is unimportant, use bullets. Use a different style or size of bullet point to denote each sublevel. (Programs such as Microsoft Word do this automatically for you.)

**CAUTION**  
Format multilevel or nested lists logically and consistently. Indent, number, or format each sublevel such that it is clear which level each list element belongs to. Inconsistent formatting can make an outline look messy and unprofessional.

## Horizontal lists
In its simplest form, a horizontal list (also called a run-in list) is a sentence with items separated by commas.

### EXAMPLES
To bake a cake, you need flour, eggs, butter, and time.
Nesbit, Lulu, and Anita have won the tournament.

**TIP**  
Use a semicolon to separate items in a list when they themselves contain internal punctuation.

### EXAMPLE
Tumkin visited Hamburg, Germany; George Town, Malaysia; and Colombo, Sri Lanka.

To make list elements stand out, to highlight their number, or to imply a sequence, use letters or numbers. Enclose these letters or numbers in parentheses to separate them from the surrounding text.

### EXAMPLES
I can’t live here because (a) it’s dirty and (b) it stinks.
Make sure to pack (1) binoculars, (2) pencils, and (c) spare socks.
On our trip to Turkey, we plan to visit the following places: (1) Istanbul, (2) Antalya, (3) Ankara, (4) Bodrum.

**CAUTION**  
Use a colon only if you use a complete sentence to introduce the list.

### EXAMPLE
Incorrect  
For his trip to Mars, Farley packed: (a) a gold watch, (b) a silk tie, (c) a pair of dress shoes.  
Correct  
For his trip to Mars, Farley packed (a) a gold watch, (b) a silk tie, (c) a pair of dress shoes.  
Correct  
For his trip to Mars, Farley packed three things: (a) a gold watch, (b) a silk tie, (c) a pair of dress shoes.  

## Parallel structure
For a list that is logical and readable, ensure parallel structure across its elements. This means that each element in your list should be of the same type functionally (word, phrase, clause, or sentence) and grammatically (nouns, verbs, adverbs, etc.). Also, don’t mix tone. If one of the points in your list is a question, all should be questions. If one is an imperative (an instruction), so must they all be.

### EXAMPLE
* Poor: Lulu loves adventure, eating ice-cream, and to laugh when she can.  
This list lacks parallel structure: the first item is a noun, the second a gerund phrase, and the third an infinitive phrase.
* Better: Lulu loves being adventurous, eating ice-cream, and laughing when she can.  
We have parallel structure: all the items in this list are gerund phrases.
* Better: Lulu loves adventure, ice-cream, and laughter.  
We’ve ensured parallel structure by rephrasing and turning all the elements into nouns.
* Better Lulu loves to be adventurous, eat ice-cream, and laugh when she can.  
All the elements in this list are infinitive phrases.

Don’t mix imperatives with factual statements and questions.

### EXAMPLE
Poor: To prepare for the apocalypse, follow these steps:
1. Buy seven crates of coconut water.
2. It’s useful to be strong and agile; try swimming every day.
3. When did you last have a dental checkup?

Each item in this list is differently structured. We have an imperative, a declarative, and an interrogative. Such a hodgepodge of sentence structures can be jarring for readers.

Better: To prepare for the apocalypse, follow these steps:
1. Buy seven crates of coconut water.
2. Stay strong and agile by going swimming every day.
3. Get a dental checkup done.

All the elements are imperatives and together read as a set of instructions.

Don’t allow the list items to be functionally different—for example, one shouldn’t be a noun and another an adjective.

### EXAMPLE
Poor: The six basic animal classes are as follows:
1. Invertebrate species 
2. Fish
3. Amphibians
4. Reptilian
5. Birds
6. Mammalian

This list lacks parallel structure because it does not consistently use nouns or adjectives.

Better: The six basic animal classes are as follows:
1. Invertebrates
2. Fish
3. Amphibians
4. Reptiles
5. Birds
6. Mammals

We’ve modified the list to make sure all the elements are nouns.

## Usage guide
Lists help organize and present information logically and sequentially. The elements of a list stand out from the rest of the text, unlike sentences in a paragraph. Use a list to provide a set of instructions or to make key points clear to your readers. If the number or order of elements is important, use numbers; otherwise, use bullets. Capitalize and punctuate your list correctly and consistently. Finally, check that your list has parallel structure.
