> I basically wrote the code and the specs and documentation for how the client and server talked to each other. - Tim Berners-Lee

Welcome to my cookbook-style documentation website on frequently used software and code snippets. I wrote the documentation in Markdown and built this website using MkDocs. 

I am happy to take suggestions or collaborate. Please write to me at [swatantra@disroot.org](mailto:swatantra@disroot.org)
