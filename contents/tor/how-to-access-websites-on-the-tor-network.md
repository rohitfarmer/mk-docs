# How to Access Websites on the Tor Network

> Attention: The documentation presented under the Tor category is intended exclusively for educational, hobbyist, and research purposes. It represents personal notes and experiences and is not suitable as guidance for individuals in vulnerable or high-risk situations.

Websites on the Tor network use special addresses ending in `.onion` and are not accessible through standard web browsers like Chrome, Safari, or Firefox. To access these sites, you need software that can connect to the Tor network and route your traffic through it.

The simplest and most widely recommended option is [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download), a modified version of Firefox that automatically connects to the Tor network and applies privacy-preserving defaults. Once installed, you can open Tor Browser, wait for it to establish a connection, and then visit a `.onion` address, for example here is the `.onion` address of my website [http://7eufinpff72b7ziin4d46b5afh6a7la2mb4ievknde2tjrdjlukiyqyd.onion/](http://7eufinpff72b7ziin4d46b5afh6a7la2mb4ievknde2tjrdjlukiyqyd.onion/), just like you would visit a regular website. No additional configuration is required for most users.

It’s important to understand that Tor prioritizes privacy over speed. Because your connection is routed through multiple relays around the world, pages may load more slowly than on the regular internet. Additionally, not all websites behave the same way on Tor, and some features—such as embedded media or third-party scripts—may be limited or disabled by default for privacy reasons.

When using Tor, users should also be mindful of basic safety practices: avoid logging into personal accounts you use outside Tor, be cautious about downloading files, and understand that Tor improves privacy but does not make users completely anonymous in all situations. Used thoughtfully, Tor is a powerful tool for accessing privacy-preserving and censorship-resistant content on the internet.

Below are some websites with `.onion` addresses or that are Tor-network-friendly and generally work reliably.
