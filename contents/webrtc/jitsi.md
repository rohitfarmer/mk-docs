# Jitsi

[Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) is an open‑source suite of real‑time communication tools that enables secure, browser‑based audio‑video conferencing, screen sharing, and instant messaging. Built on the [WebRTC (Web Real‑Time Communications)](https://webrtc.org/) standard, Jitsi lets participants join a meeting directly from a web browser or mobile app without the need for plugins, downloads, or proprietary client software.

Key characteristics of Jitsi include:

* Free and open source – The core projects (Jitsi Meet, Jitsi Videobridge, Jicofo, and related components) are released under permissive licenses, allowing anyone to inspect, modify, or self‑host the software.
* End‑to‑end encryption – Media streams are encrypted between the client and the server, and Jitsi Meet offers optional additional encryption layers for enhanced privacy.
* Scalable architecture – Jitsi Videobridge acts as a selective forwarding unit (SFU), efficiently routing video streams so that each participant receives only the streams they need, which reduces bandwidth usage and supports large meetings.
* Zero‑install participation – Users simply open a URL such as https://meet.jit.si/YourRoomName in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari, and the conference starts instantly. Mobile apps are available for Android and iOS.
* Feature‑rich – Built‑in capabilities include screen sharing, live captions, recording (via integrations like Jibri), virtual backgrounds, chat, polls, and integration with external authentication providers (OAuth, LDAP, etc.).
* Community‑driven ecosystem – A vibrant community contributes plugins, custom deployments, and documentation, and many organizations run their own public or private Jitsi instances (e.g., Greenhost, Mayfirst, Framatalk, Disroot).

Because it is open source and runs on standard web technologies, Jitsi is widely adopted by privacy‑focused individuals, NGOs, educational institutions, and enterprises that prefer to retain control over their communication infrastructure while avoiding vendor lock‑in. Whether you need a quick ad‑hoc meeting or a fully self‑hosted video‑conferencing platform, Jitsi provides a flexible, cost‑effective foundation for modern online collaboration.
