# Online Services

Websites providing online services such as email, chat, social, etc.

> Note: I don't know which one of these is still operational. I also don't know how secure these servers are - I found them through a Google search. Use them at your own discretion. Also, I believe some of these services are run by volunteers, so please don't abuse the system. Let it be a resource available for everyone.
