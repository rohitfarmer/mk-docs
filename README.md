# MkDocs Website Code

MkDocs: [https://www.mkdocs.org/](https://www.mkdocs.org/)  
Theme used: [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)

The website can be built or served locally. However, I use Netlify to build the website whenever I push new changes to this repository and serve it at [https://docs.rohitfarmer.com](https://docs.rohitfarmer.com). I followed this tutorial to set up an automatic build and serve by Netlify [https://www.starfallprojects.co.uk/projects/deploy-host-docs/deploy-mkdocs-material-netlify/](https://www.starfallprojects.co.uk/projects/deploy-host-docs/deploy-mkdocs-material-netlify/). 

## To build the site locally
```bash
cd mk-docs
mkdocs build
```

## To serve the site on a local server
```bash
cd mk-docs
mkdocs serve
```
